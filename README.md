# Task 1
#### step 1
See data.json where you will find
`{
    studentCharges,
    elevatorInfo
}`


 and see collection stored in mongodb atlas in the following uri address you will find three attribute i
 uri = `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.b6utj.mongodb.net/vibesBackendChallenge?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

`
new Schema({
        financialAid: Mixed,
        retentionAndGraduation: Mixed,
        unitId: Number
    })
`
 
  Merged those two datas (data.json and document stored in mongodb) with key of unitId present in both, and name that new collection 'university'. 

  Data.json has 9 doc and model in mongodb `aidretentionandgraduations` also has 9 doc, merge it and form a new model called `university`


# Final Merged File Should look like:


## Data types:
#### number should be converted to number
#### null or NaN should be placed if no number is present
object keys such as `Full-time,_First-time,_Degree/certificate-seeking_Undergraduate_Students` can be written in more better way `firstTimeFullTimeUndergrad`
        
Final data structure in univerity collection document should look like:

Number values should be cleaned and converted to int or float!
`$5,603` => 5603
`90%` => 90.00
